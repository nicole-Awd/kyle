      <h3>Learn to ride and get licensed!</h3>


      <img src="/images/cmsp_trans.png" class="inlineRight" />

      <p>We are part of the <i>California Motorcyclist Safety Program</i> and we are certified to teach the CMSP Motorcyclist Training Course (MTC). The MTC is mandatory for those under the age of 21, but is also recommended to those 21 and older who are seeking to obtain a motorcycle endorsement on their California driver license.</p>

      <div class="clear"></div>

      <img src="/images/mtc2.jpg" class="inlineLeft" />

      <p>The Motorcyclist Training Course is designed for the novice rider with no (or limited) street-riding experience. A typical class schedule consists of 5 hours of classroom instruction and 10 hours of riding practice. During this motorcycle riding course, you will learn fundamental skills required to operate the motorcycle and progress to street riding skills and strategies. Even though the Motorcycle Training Course was designed with new riders in mind, most experienced riders that have taken the course have reported improving their riding skills considerably with it!</p>

      <p>Topics covered include fear, understanding how motorcycles turn, proper cornering strategies, and emergency crash avoidance skills. The course is based on the most current research in rider safety, and utilizes modern training methods.</p>


      <h3>Completion of the MTC waives the DMV riding skills test</h3>

      <p>Upon successful completion of the Motorcyclist Training Course you will receive a DMV riding test waiver. There are written and riding evaluations after the course to ensure you have competence in the material covered in the basic course. You must pass both evaluations to graduate.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>



<!--     <div class="border doubleMargin" style="padding: 30px;">
    
      <h3 class="first fontRed center">IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK</h3>
    
      <h3>Should I sign up for my basic motorcycling class which includes earning my motorcycle endorsement/license or should I wait for the pandemic to be over?</h3>
          
          <p>Yes, you definitely should sign-up for your class now. Students who enroll now and participate in our Zoom classes which are running once a week, will be the some of the first motorcyclists in California to get their motorcycle licenses once full classes resume.</p>
          
          
          
          <h3>I would like to get my motorcycle license right now, is that possible?</h3>
          
          <p>No, there are no CMSP behind the wheel classes available right now and DMV has no motorcycle classes, testing or credentialing activities in the state of California operating at this time.</p>
          
          
          <h3>How has COVID-19 effected the CMSP/CHP MTC motorcycle classes? </h3>
          
          <p>Our in-classroom experience has shifted to a Zoom meeting online experience, fully accredited and approved by the CHP. The Zoom meeting is held by a live, experienced CMSP certified instructor, the very same that you would experience in classroom sessions in the past. The curriculum is also equal to that of the past classes in every way. Zoom meetings also allow for questions and interactions between instructor and the student. An e-class will also be available in May 2020 for those who prefer the "e" experience.</p> 
          
          
          
          <h3>When can I do the behind the wheel training or practical part of the class?</h3>
          
          <p>We at Pacific Motorcycle Training are as eager and ready to do the behind the wheel classes as you are. As soon CHP gives us a green light to begin operations for the practical, we will be posting available dates and sending out notices to contact you immediately to book you at your convenience for the bike experience.</p>
          
          
          
          <h3>I need to get my motorcycle license right now, what's the best way to get the motorcycle license right now?</h3>
          
          <p>Motorcycle licenses are not available at this time.</p>
          
          
          
          <h3>I did my motorcycle training class earlier this year and I have my certificate DL 389 in hand. How do I go about getting my motorcycle license now?</h3>
          
          <p>Motorcyclist licenses are not available at this time. Sorry check back once DMV has re-opened.</p>
           
          
          
          
          <h3>What is your rescheduling policy if I need to change or reschedule all or any part of my class?</h3> 
          
          <p>Re-scheduling is open at this time. We will be holding Zoom classes in their entirety once a week every week. Students can get 1/2 of the class completed and certified. Zoom classes are done on a tablet, computer of phone and can be done from the safety and comfort of your home. Computer experience, tech experience not needed for these meetings they're very simple to join and interact in. For those who prefer a live classroom, we would be happy to reschedule your whole class--no fees, no hassles, no worries. We will begin to reschedule full classes for those who do not want to join our zoom meeting classrooms as soon as CHP has given us clearance to re-start full classes.</p>

    <h3>Can I take the course if I am under 21 years old?</h3>

    <p>Yes! If you are over 15Â½ and under 18, you must bring a photo ID and a parent or legal guardian to sign a waiver with you. Your parent must provide ID as well. Once the waiver is signed you are ready to participate.</p>

    <h3>What are the benefits of taking the course?</h3>

    <p>Upon successfully completion of the California Motorcyclist Safety Program MTC course, you will receive a DMV riding evaluation waiver. If you are under 21 years of age and you want a California motorcycle license, you must successfully complete the course to get licensed.</p>

    <h3>Will my insurance be reduced?</h3>

    <p>Likely! Many insurance companies recognize the CMSP courses and offer discounts after successful completion of the course. Many companies even offer discounts on your car insurance as well.</p>

    <h3>What if I have ridden before? Is this course right for me?</h3>

    <p>Yes! While the basics are covered, our instructors also evaluate the riding of more experienced riders. After many years of teaching we have found that even experienced riders have much to gain from this course.</p>


    <h3>What is the content of the class?</h3>

    <p>The basic class is based on many years of motorcycle safety research conducted by <a href="http://www.totalcontroltraining.net/">Total Control Training</a>. We utilize the most updated motorcycle safety information to provide a professional learning experience.</p>

    <h3>How long is the basic course?</h3>

    <p>The course consists of two classroom sessions and two riding sessions for a total of approximately 15 hours. The typical curriculum is: Classroom 1 - Range 1 - Classroom 2 - Range 2</p>

    <h3>What should I bring to the first day of class?</h3>

    <p>You must bring:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>A current, valid, government issued photo ID. This may be issued from California, any State or any Country</li>
        <li>A completed PMT waiver</li>
        <li>Proper riding gear for the range session (see the next question)</li>
        <li>Water in a reusable bottle and snacks</li>
        <li>Pens and notepad</li>
      </ul>
    </p>


    <h3>What gear do I need to bring? Are there any provided?</h3>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full-finger, 100% leather or street specific motorcycle gloves</li>
        <li>Long sturdy pants with no holes (denim jeans, leather pants, motorcycle specific pants)</li>
        <li>Over-the-ankle protective boots</li>
        <li>DOT-approved helmet, if you have one (full-face or modular)</li>
        <li>Eye Protection</li>
        <li>Long sleeve shirt or jacket</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p><b>PMT provides motorcycles and helmets.</b> You may use your own DOT-approved modular or full face helmet if desired.</p>


    <h3>What size are the motorcycles?</h3>

    <p>The motorcycles provided range from 125cc to 250cc at SSF, San Jose and Salinas. At Livermore they are Harley Davidson Street 500s (HD's entry level cruiser).</p>

    
    <h3>What if I am a shorter rider (Under 5'3")? What location should I ride at?</h3>
    <p>Take the MTC class in SSF, San Jose or Salinas. NOT Livermore.</p>



    <h3>Can I bring my own motorcycle?</h3>

    <p>Yes! As long as you provide proof of current registration, current insurance and it is under 500cc.</p>


    <h3>Can I take the course on a scooter?</h3>

    <p>Yes! If you have a scooter under 500cc, you may use it to take the class.</p>


    <h3>How do I graduate from the course?</h3>

    <p>There are written and riding evaluations to ensure you have competence in the material covered in the basic course. You must attent all sessions in full and pass both evaluations to graduate the course.</p>


    <h3>How do I get my California motorcycle license (M1) and how long does it take?</h3>

    <p>After successful completion of the basic course you will be mailed a California DMV form DL389. With this form and the passing of the DMV written evaluation you will be eligible for a M1 motorcycle endorsement. It takes up to 10 business days to receive the DMV waiver in the mail.</p>


    <h3>What if I'm not able to pass the class?</h3>

    <p>Sometimes students are unable to pass the class on the first try. If you do not pass the skills evaluation or the writing evaluation, you may schedule a retest. Please <a href="/contact">call us</a> for details. If you fail both evaluations, you must re-enroll and take the entire course from the start at the full tuition rate.</p>


    <h3>What is the riding range like?</h3>

    <p>The riding ranges are generally at the parking lot of the designated location&mdash;on a closed course free of traffic.</p>



    <h3>Will I be ready to ride after passing the course?</h3>

    <p>When you pass the class you would have been taught the basics of motorcycle operation. We give you the tools, but it is up to you to sharpen the tools and continue practicing to become a safe responsible rider.</p>

    <h3>What is overnight paperwork?</h3>

    <p>Upon successful completion of the class you are going to get your DMV waiver/Discount Card very quickly. Most students see it within 2 business days of the class being processed. Normally, it takes up to 10 business days.</p>

      <h2>Course Policies</h2>

      <h3>Safety First</h3>

      <p>Safety is our number one priority. The Motorcycle Training Course (MTC) is designed to provide an enjoyable learning experience for all students.</p>



      <h3>Class Expectations</h3>

      <p>Students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner. We have a ZERO tolerance policy for alcohol and other drugs. Students who fail to respond to coaching or intentionally interfere with other students learning may be asked to leave. Our goal is to create a safe, positive learning environment.</p>



      <h3>Refunds and Rescheduling</h3>

      <p>This is a non-refundable course.</p>
      <p>You may cancel up to 6 business days before the class, minus a $100 service charge.</p>
      <p>If you cancel within 6 business days, you forfeit the entire course fee, or must pay a partial fee of $165 as a standby student.</p>
      <p>If you are LATE or NO-SHOW to any portion of the class, you forfeit the entire course fee.</p>
      <p>If you fail the knowledge or skills test, you may retake it for $75 fee. You must call the office within 30 days of failed class. Failure to call will result in a forfeiture of tuition and you must re-enroll into a new class at full tuition. Students who fail the Skills test may schedule into another riding session for a partial fee of $165 as a standby student. Students NOT able to participate safely have to pay a partial fee of $165 as a standby student.</p>

      <h4>Under 21?</h4>
      <p>Students under 21 before your first day of class, please be advised that your reduced fee of $295.00 will be charged and reflect on your confirmation letter that you will receive after you hit the submit button below. You will not need to take further action to receive the under-21 tuition price.</p>

      <p>Students putting false or in-accurate birth dates in order to get reduced fees may be subject to the $55 difference or be dismissed from class and lose their entire course fees.</p>

      <h3>Late Policy</h3>
      <p>The State program prohibits us from allowing any student into any portion of the class who is late. Please plan on being at least 15 minutes early to all training sessions. Plan ahead and allow for extra time given the Bay Area traffic conditions.</p>

      <h3>Security And Privacy</h3>
      <p>Your payment and personal information is always safe. Our Transport Layer Security (TLS) software is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read over the internet.</p>
